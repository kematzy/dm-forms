= DataMapper Forms

DataMapper model form generation.

<<<<<<< HEAD:README.rdoc
=======
== Features:

* Integrates with DataMapper
* Fast; over 1000 elements in 0.1 seconds (rake benchmark)
* Error reporting
* Handles restful HTTP verbs
* Provides low-level form elements uncoupled from DataMapper

== Examples:

Pretend in a magical world we have a User model, and only the email is valid while we are updating.
Based on the situation above, the form would render similar to the markup beneath the
example.

   errors_for @user
   form_for @user, :action => '/user' do |f|
     f.textfield :name, :label => 'Name'
     f.textfield :email, :label => 'Email'
     f.submit :op, :value => 'Update'
   end

   <ul class="messages error">
     <li>Name has an invalid format</li>
   </ul>
   <form action="/user" method="post" id="form-user">
     <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put" />
     <label for="name">Name:</label>
     <input type="textfield" class="error form-textfield form-name" name="name" />
     <label for="email">Email:</label>
     <input type="textfield" class="form-textfield form-email" name="email" />
     <input type="submit" class="form-submit form-op" value="Update" name="op" />
   </form>
